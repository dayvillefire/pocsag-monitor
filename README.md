# POCSAG-MONITOR

Golang POCSAG512 monitor, designed to be run on a Linux machine.

This code has been run on a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://amzn.to/3bflIyP) (the slower first-generation model) if anyone wants to run this on a standalone single-chip machine.

POCSAG monitor is currently keyed to publish to a Discord channel.
